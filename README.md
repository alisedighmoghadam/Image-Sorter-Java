A simple program that sort your images based on dimensions. Personal project. ( In progress ) 

# What is Sorter? 

Have you ever thought about how I can sort my images based on their dimensions? 
For example, you downloaded very cool wallpapers for your PC and mobile phone, but they got mixed up, and you need to separate portrait and wide photos manually. I personally faced this problem a lot becuase\n 
I always like to have fresh background pictures for my laptop and phone, and when I download a bunch of photos from <a href="www.unsplash.com>Unsplash<a/> , I need to sort them manually by dimensions so I can import photos to my phone. 
This application can be used in other situations as well. For example you came back from a long photoshoot from your product, and now you want to use the photos for your <a href="www.instagram.com>Instagram<a/>  posts and stories, but you need to take a lot of time to sort them based on their dimensions.
